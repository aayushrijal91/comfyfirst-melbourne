						<p class="display-3 fw-bold line-height-1 ">Thermosiphon Roof Mounted Solar Hot Water</p>
						<hr class="hr-h hr-white ">

						<p class="text-tlblue">Rheem's roof mounted tank systems save space at ground level and their elegant simplicity make them efficient and reliable. All Rheem solar hot water systems, where the tank is roof-mounted, use the Thermosiphon principle to collect heat from the sun and transfer it to your hot water. The Thermosiphon principle is based on two naturally occurring phenomena: Dark objects absorb heat and hot water rises.</p>

						<p class="text-tlblue">Rheem solar collectors are coated with a heat-absorbent surface. This coating absorbs the energy from the suns rays and heats the fluid in the collectors. As the fluid heats, it rises to the top of the collectors and into the tank where it displaces cooler fluid which flows into the bottom of the collectors where the process is repeated.</p>

						<p class="text-tlblue">In this way Rheem solar water heaters constantly soak up the sun's energy to maximise your energy savings. With a Rheem thermosiphon solar hot water heating system you can choose from a range of boosters including in-tank electric or in-line gas boosters to ensure you always have hot water on tap, even on cloudy days.</p>

								<p class="display-3 fw-bold line-height-1 ">Split System Solar Hot Water</p>
								<hr class="hr-h hr-white ">

								<p class="text-tlblue">Rheem's split system solar water heaters are designed to give you the maximum flexibility of installation locations. The low profile and unobtrusive Rheem solar collectors are mounted on a roof facing the equator, whilst the storage tank is mounted at ground level out of sight. The electric boosted model can even be installed inside your home. This minimises the visual impact of going solar, while maximising the potential savings from the sun.</p>

								<p class="text-tlblue">With a Rheem solar hot water split system you can choose from a range of boosters including in-tank electric or in-line gas continuous flow boosting to ensure you always have hot water on tap even on cloudy days.

								<p class="display-3 fw-bold line-height-1 ">Rheem Heat Pump Water Heaters</p>
								<hr class="hr-h hr-white ">

								<p class="text-tlblue">The Rheem heat pump is a smart, energy efficient alternative for areas where a traditional solar water heater may not be suitable, such as an application with a shaded north facing roof. Rather than using roof mounted collectors, efficient heat pump technology extracts energy from the surrounding air. Ambient warmth is used to convert the refrigerant within the sealed system into a gas. The gas is then compressed to generate even more heat which then heats the water in the tank. Whatâ€™s more this process can work day or night, in sunshine and rain, all year round.</p>

								<p class="text-tlblue">Installation is quick and easy. The heat pump water heater can usually be installed in the same location as an outdoor electric water heater and connected up to the existing plumbing and electrical connections, making it a great replacement for an existing water heater. It is also equipped with an electric booster designed to operate only in very cold conditions to ensure a quick and efficient supply of hot water when you may need it most. The ceramic lined tank is further protected by its sacrificial anode.</p>

								<p class="text-tlblue">When you choose PlumbFirst for your plumbing, hot water and drain needs across <?= $global_city ?>, you can be sure of a level of expert, friendly service which is second-to-none. You can read more about our customer satisfaction guarantee on this page here, from our other happy customers here, or call us and discover for yourself why we're already the trusted choice in other <?= $global_city ?> homes for their solar hot water needs.</p>
